		<p>This set of sketchbooks were all bound at separate times most elements held consistant and several others varied so as to produce distinct products, but so as to create a set of objects with recognizable themes and furthermore, so as to practice the coptic binding on the same scale.  Because I spend many hours each week (averaging more than an hour/day) drawing the human figure, I use reams of paper each year, and thus have frequent need of new sketchbooks.  These texts, coptic bound so they fall open flat or ever farther, usually made with strathmore 400 drawing or pastel paper, and sturdy in construction serve as a convenient and fitting repository for my sketches.  </p>

		  <p>I required each book to be coptic bound, and to use hardwood for its covers.  The threads that bind the covers, I allowed to be selected based on the other cover materials.  The first materials were metals, steel and copper, but the third was a heavy canvas for which I devised a cutting pattern to hide all cut edges. This material in turn begged for hemp twine as the binding thread.  With each continuing addition to this set of texts, I have challenged myself to alter the materials and find new processes and methods while remaining within the constraints of hardwood covers and coptic binding.     </p>

		  <p>This last sketcbook with delicate 1/8" C-chanel was the first coptic book I ever bound and also started off this series of hardwood texts.  I have been particularly inspired in this pursuit by the gorgeous fine art works of Ian Boyden, which often use hardwoods and other innovative but pleasing materials, such as piano lacqueur or metal plates as covers.   </p>
