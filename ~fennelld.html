<p>My name is Daniel Fennelly, and I am a student at Reed College in the psychology department. I'm specifically interested in perception, cognition, philosophy of psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. Lately I've been reading more and more about dynamic systems and connectionist approaches to embodiment and development. I've been particularly interested in the philosophical ideas of Andy Clark, Alva Noe, Shaun Gallagher, Merleau-Ponty, and Heidegger, and how one should actively apply philosophy to research in psychology and neuroscience.
<p>In my spare time I enjoy playing tabletop games with friends, reading science fiction, and juggling. The picture to the right shows me spinning poi in the quad at Reed.
<p>If you would like to contact me, you can reach me online at: fennelld (at) reed.edu
